## üß™ 1. Problem Definition & Domain Context

- **Goal**: Predict chemical **bond strengths** (-ICOHP values) in metallic glasses at density functional theory (DFT)-level accuracy.

  - üìù **NOTE**: Within the context of Computational Chemistry, the "integrated COHP (the -ICOHP value) hints towards the **bond strength**"; COHP stands for ([Crystal Orbital Hamilton Populations](https://schmeling.ac.rwth-aachen.de/cohp/index.php?menuID=1)).

- **Challenge**: Direct DFT computation is computationally infeasible for large-scale (e.g. 10k-atom) systems, whose atomic level whole structure is more realistic.

## üß© 2. Data Generation & Labeling (DataOps phase)

- **Raw Data Sources**:

  - Classical Molecular Dynamics (CMD) simulations are used to to generate an ensemble of smaller systems (100-atom cells) whose atomic level local environments are representative of those found on large-scale systems.

  - Feasible first-principles electronic structure simulations based on DFT to compute -ICOHP values (**labels**) for the smaller systems.

- **Data Engineering**:

  - Convert atomic configurations (local environment around central atoms in terms of its neighbours; or simply **local atomic fingerprints**) to SOAP descriptors (**feature engineering**).
 
    - üìù **NOTE**: Within the context of Computational Chemistry/Materials Science, SOAP stands for ([Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115)).

  - Database of interactions (DBIs) includes **bond distance**, **bond strengths**, and **local atomic fingerprints**.

    - üìù **NOTE**: In the end, what has been implemented was a **Feature Store Lite**, where each output DBI is the **structured** and **versioned input** to the ML model. 

- **Labeling Strategy**:

  - -ICOHP values calculated via DFT and COHP analysis are used as **supervised labels**.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Model Development (ModelOps phase)

- **Machine Learning (ML) Approach**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).

- **Feature Inputs**:

  - SOAP vectors for atoms in bonds (the SOAP descriptor itself is a feature vector; the ***dot product-based SOAP kernel*** measures similarity and can be used to derive a ***metric distance***).

  - Bond distances.

- **Custom Kernel Function**:

  - Designed to combine bond distance and SOAP similarity.

- **Output**: Predicted -ICOHP value (bond strength).

- **Evaluation**:

  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on test data per **bond/interaction type**.
 
  - **Data augmentation** by applying geometric transformations (shear, tension, compression) to 100-atom cells generated by MD simulations to generate more structural diversity and improve ML generalization.

  - Satisfactory performance demonstrated with small training sets.
